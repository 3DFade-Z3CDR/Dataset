To mitigate potential misuse and ensure the security of cloud manufacturing systems, the source code for SHIE3D model is not publicly released. However, we provide a detailed description of the attack methodology in the paper to support reproducibility.
Therefore, here we have only made the attack dataset and the defense code for Z3CDR publicly available.
# Dataset
This dataset contains 3D files of various attack types and complexity generated by SHIE3D.
